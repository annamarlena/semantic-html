# Semantic HTML Homework Assignment

## Objective

The objective of this project was to rename the div tags that should have had semantic HTML tags which follow a logical structure. Once renamed, one of the tags (the nav tag) broke the code, so it was necessary to update the corresponding CSS. Additionally, there was a broken link which needed fixing, a heading attribute that needed to be updated from h2 to h4, a title element added, and alt attributes added for the images.

Per the instructions, we were also supposed to comment the CSS.
