# Semantic HTML Assignment

## Objective

The primary objective of this project was to rename the div tags to semantic HTML tags following a logical structure. Once renamed, the nav tag broke the code, making it necessary to update the corresponding CSS file. Additionally, a broken navigation link in the header was fixed, the title was updated, alt attributes were added to the images, and the footer H tag was updated from h2 to h4.

Per the instructions, the CSS was commented to show understanding. I also rearranged the CSS to more closely match the chronological order of the HTML. This wasn't necesary for the assignment, but makes it easier to find the CSS that corresponds to each section of the HTML.
